# [Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)](https://www.dpdk.org/)
DPDK is a framework for performance-intensive applications that require fast packet processing, low latency, and consistent performance. 
- DPDK provides a set of data plane libraries and a network interface controller (NIC) that bypass the kernel network and run directly in the user space. 

Usecases: enabling DPDK on your VM is useful when running the following:
- Network function virtualization (NFV) deployments
- Software-defined networking (SDN) applications
- Video streaming or voice over IP applications
